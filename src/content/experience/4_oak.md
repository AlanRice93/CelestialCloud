### Web Development Intern

_[Oak Studios](https://oak.is)_ **2016**

Four month web development internship straight out of a coding bootcamp. My first professional working experience (getting paid to code woohoo!)

- Provided designs for [CreativeMornings Contest](http://freelancer.creativemornings.com) and tasked with building it as a static site from scratch. I also integrated the site with a CMS, giving the customer the ability to update articles and sponsorships without engineering intervention.
- Fixed issues/bugs in [WorkingNotWorking](https://workingnotworking.com). This was a huge codebase with thousands of contributors. Fixes included payment flow issues in Stripes, interactive issues with toasts/modals, etc.
