### Web Developer

_[Authorea](https://authorea.com)_ **2016-2017**

Open source text editor using Markdown, LaTeX, version control, etc to allow collaboritve writing of scientific papers. This started as a 30-day trial that turned into a full-time role. Ended up being responsible for almost all the user-facing changes (mostly CSS and [React](https://react.dev/)).

- Rebuilt the landing-page from scratch during my 30-day contract. This included working with a designer, optimizing images, and included carousels, a twitter feed, etc.
- Built out dozens of features for the text editor's interface, which is similar to Microsoft Word. The editor had hundreds of options contained in different dropdown menus.
- Debugged and enhanced complex state management in [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), which had to handle hundreds of session-level configurations for the text editor.
