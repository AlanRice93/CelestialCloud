### Software Engineer

_[Ride Health](https://ridehealth.com)_ **2017-2020**

Healthcare startup that connected patients with mobility providers based hundreds of criteria such as service level, frequency, location, prior-auth, etc. I was the second hire, and worked alongside the CTO for two years to build out the system, eventually facilitating over 1000 trips a day for patients.

- Deployed an IVR system using Twilio and Elixir, allowing patients to call in take real-time actions for rides (request, cancel, etc), fetch information (how many rides do I have coming up? when is my next ride?). The system deployed with 0 bugs and reduced our customer support team's weekly-minutes-on-phone by over 80% within two weeks.
- Built an internal system that pinged Uber to get accurate ride estimates for different zip codes. We exported the data to BigQuery so our data team could make informed decisions about which providers could service which areas inline with our SLA's.
- Hired and mentored team members as we grew to six full-time engineers.
